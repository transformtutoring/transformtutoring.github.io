Special Interest Courses: 

Different cohorts available for all age groups K-12. 

Human Genetics: course focused on human genetics. We will (1) review basic biology concepts, (2) talk about how human genetics relates to human health, and (3) discuss how recent advances in human genetics impacts our society. Learned skills: Technical reading; analyses of a scientific topics; rhetorical analysis essay
Instructor: Rebecca (Ph.D. Biology?, Stanford University 2021?)


Microbiology: course focused on the tiny organisms that interact with us. We will (1) discuss basic microbiological concepts, (2) learn about microbiology and food, and (3) learn about the human microbiota. Learned skills: How to read scientific literature; core understanding of microbiology; research skills
Instructor: Rebecca (Ph.D. Biology?, Stanford University 2021?)

Science and Society: Enrichment course focused on the overlap between science and society. We will begin to understand the social, legal, historical, and policy issues stemming from research and technological advances. Seminar-style course. Learned skills: advanced reading, writing, and analysis of complex topics.
Instructor: Rebecca (Ph.D. Biology?, Stanford University 2021?)

Web Development: Students will learn how to create dynamic web pages using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript--essential parts of any website, and a backbone from which they can create even more advanced projects. They will learn how to apply essential programming language concepts, select a web hosting service relevant for their use case, and publish their webpages for a public audience. They will develop a model for creating their own personal or business website, and learn fundamentals of design and layout. Learned skills: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, design fundamentals, web hosting, introductory UI principles.
Instructor: Ayush (B.S. Bioengineering, Stanford University 2021?)

Synthetic Biology: The course begins with an exploration of the components of DNA and how it dictates the creation of protein structures within a cell through the processes of transcription and translation. Then, we will explore analogs in engineering by examining biological circuits as combinations of biomolecule-based transformers, capacitors, and other components and design circuits that would accomplish various tasks relevant to the real world. Students will choose a real-world problem (e.g. detecting contaminants in drinking water) and design a synthetic biology system to address it. Learned skills: principles of genetics, principles of engineering, design thinking. 
Instructor: Ayush (B.S. Bioengineering, Stanford University 2021?)

Physical Computing with Arduino: The course will begin with teaching principles of programming and hardware through hands-on experimentation with Arduino components. No prior knowledge of programming or hardware is necessary. Learned skills: basic programming principles such as control flow, loops, and variable types; hardware fundamentals including sensory inputs and outputs; design thinking
Instructor: Ayush (B.S. Bioengineering, Stanford University 2021?)
