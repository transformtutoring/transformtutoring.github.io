➢ College Consulting: Strategy Package

Outcome: Your student will gain an understanding of the college admissions process, a clearer picture of their own interests and career goals, and next steps to gain admission into a college that best prepares them for these goals. 

Timeline Template: 

Below is a sample timeline for our strategy package. This will vary between students, and some may require more sessions depending on the student’s understanding of their own interests, and how much progress the student makes on assigned action items outside of sessions. 

Session 1: Understanding Your Student

College consultant will build rapport with your student and understand what academic, extracurricular, and career interests they have. 

Session 2: Ikigai & Career Fulfillment

College consultant and student will discuss the concept of Ikigai, which is a framework for identifying a career pursuit that combines one’s skills and passions with what the world needs and what the job market will pay for. College consultant will use knowledge gained from Session 1 and further questions during this session to identify viable and fulfilling career options. 

For students who already have a relatively well-defined career path, college consultant will discuss the day-to-day skills and knowledge used during the years of study and training for their chosen career. 

Session 3: Identifying a Major, Program, and College

College consultant and student will discuss which majors, programs, and universities will best prepare them for the career(s) they are interested in pursuing. This will depend on both the academic preparation required for a student’s chosen career as well as the network and faculty that institutions offer for different fields of study. 

Session 4: College Admissions Basics 

College consultant will discuss with student the path to college admissions, starting with the relevant information for the student’s current year in high school. This will include basics about standardized testing, high school course selection and grades, and the details of the college application process itself. College consultant will assign readings written by college admissions officers that lay the foundation for what the student should be aware of when applying. 

Session 5: Standing Out in the Applicant Pool 

College consultant will discuss the more personal aspects of the college admissions process including extracurricular choices, leadership, volunteerism, creating a capstone project, and crafting admissions essays. Using student-specific knowledge gained throughout previous sessions, college consultant will discuss how student can use their knowledge and skills to illustrate their passion for their field of choice. 

Session 6: Next Steps 

College consultant and student will create a plan with next steps for how to successfully apply to colleges that will propel them into the career of their choice. This will involve identifying student’s current strengths and weaknesses (i.e. ahead, on track, or behind in academics, extracurriculars, leadership, volunteerism, and capstone project), and college consultant will provide resources and recommendations to put student on track in all aspects of their application. 


➢ College Consulting: Capstone Project Package

Outcome: Your student will demonstrate leadership and dedication to community service by designing and executing a project that leverages their academic and extracurricular interests. 

Timeline Template: 

Below is a sample timeline for creating a capstone project. This will vary between students, and some may require more sessions depending on the nature of the project and how much progress the student makes on assigned action items outside of sessions. 

Session 1: Understanding your student (this session can be omitted if your student is continuing from the Strategy Package and their college consultant is already familiar with their interests)

College consultant will build rapport with your student and understand what academic, extracurricular, and career interests they have. 

Session 2: Brainstorming Project Ideas 

College consultant will suggest project ideas for student to lead. Projects will incorporate one or multiple of the interests discussed in the previous session, and be community-service oriented so that student can show a commitment to volunteering. 

Session 3: Selecting a Project & Initial Action Items

College consultant will discuss what the different projects brainstormed would entail, and assess student's interest in pursuing each of the projects, along with feasibility. If student demonstrates interest in multiple projects, a start time will be decided for each of them. Action items including researching school clubs, nonprofits, and other organizations to partner with will be assigned to the student. 

Session 4: Establishing Scope & Objectives 

With the organizations in the student's community in mind, the student and college consultant will work together to establish the scope of the project and what it aims to achieve. The student will leave this session with a clear understanding of how their capstone project will create its desired impact (e.g. teaching a custom curriculum that combines two of their passions every week at a low-income school; building a device that will help streamline a process that is frequently needed in a place they already volunteer; etc.)

Session 5: Outreach to Community Partners

Student and college consultant will decide on which organizations chosen after the previous sessions would be ideal community partners for the capstone project. College consultant will instruct student on how to reach out to community partners in a professional manner and build a rapport with them. Action items for contacting the community partners identified will be assigned to the student.

Session 6: Beginning Execution 

Based on responses from community partners, the student and college consultant will establish the next steps to begin executing the project with the community partners. Action items for completing these steps and communicating them with the community partners will be assigned to the student.

Check-In Sessions: 

After the groundwork of the project is laid in the previous sessions, the college consultant will be available for as many check-ins as necessary to keep the student's capstone project on track, assess progress, and recommend troubleshooting steps for any issues that arise. Frequency of check-ins is flexible--once a month for approximately 6 months after the project has begun execution has been the most commonly needed amount. Action items for improving and/or troubleshooting will be assigned for any issues that arise.
