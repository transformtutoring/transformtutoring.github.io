## About Summer Classes

Our summer classes are a 7-10 week course, designed to prepare your student for the upcoming school year's content. <h7>Students should expect 2-6 hours of homework and a regular pace of learning.</h7>

Classes are led in a <h7>1-on-1 or 1-on-2 environment</h7> at a <h7>regular, honors, or AP level</h7>. Finally, classes are <h7>tailored to incorporate long-term study habit improvement, test-taking skills, etc.</h7>

At Transform, we are strong proponents of individualized teaching. 

All of our workshops & summer classes have <h7>1-2 students</h7>.

We are <h7>strong proponents of small group classes</h7> for 2 key reasons:

#### 1. Engagement
<br>
We've switched to a 1-on-1 and 1-on-2 teaching format because we've found it to be an entirely different experience for students than group classes. With classes of 6+ people, we've found <h7>kids tend to zone out, pay partial attention, and retain less than 60% of the full course value.</h7>This is especially true in virtual environments. 

On the other hand, in 1-on-1 and 1-on-2 environments, students are taught content <h7>socratically and interactively</h7>, so it's almost impossible for them to not engage. 

Additionally, homework practice is incredibly important in developing long-term retention in students. <h7>With the small group structure, we've found kids are far more likely to complete the assigned homework problems each week.<h7> 

#### 2. Student Learning
<br>
Students need a comfortable environment to ask questions about content they don't understand. 

In a class with 10+ students, most students simply <h7>don't</h7> speak up and ask questions. In a 1-on-2 environment where the teacher actively engages the students, our students do in fact speak up, resulting in a better learning experience.
