## About Summer Classes

At Transform, we are strong proponents of individualized teaching. 

All of our workshops & summer classes have <b>no more than 3 students</b>. The average enrollment for classes is <b>2 students</b>. 

We are __strong proponents of small group classes__ for 2 key reasons:

1. __Engagement:__ Most classes have 10+ students enrolled, and as a result, students can be found zoning out, on their phones, or simply not getting the full value of a class. <br><br> At Transform, we create a curriculum where our teachers __actively engage students with questions for the full session duration__, to ensure they receive the full attention and help they need. __Classes operate more like 1-on-1 tutoring, rather than a class.__
<br><br><br>
2. __Student Learning:__ Students need a comfortable environment to ask questions about content they don't understand. In a class with 10+ students, most students simply __don't__ speak up and ask questions. In a 1-on-2 environment where the teacher actively engages the students, our students do in fact speak up, resulting in a better learning experience.
<br><br><br>

Transform Tutoring is proud to pair your student with some of the Bay Area's most gifted teachers. We offer __summer classes__ from June - August and __mini-classes__ from August - June.

## Career Deep Dive Series
What does a career in biomedical engineering, journalism, or medicine **actually involve**? 

Over 7 weeks, our team will take your student through our signature career guidance method to help them identify careers that will bring their passion to life.

Further, they'll discover the skills involved in those professions and complete projects which replicate the day-to-day of that career path.

Finally, students are matched with internships, lab positions at top 10 universities, and  leadership positionsÂ in their area of interest. 

Finally, our course will familiarize students with what skills, knowledge, and proactive steps they should take to embark in the career of their choice.
