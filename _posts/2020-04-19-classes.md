## About Summer Classes

At Transform, we are strong proponents of individualized teaching. 

All of our workshops & summer classes have __no more than 3 students__. The average enrollment for classes is __2 students__. 

We are __strong proponents of small group classes__ for 2 key reasons:

1. __Engagement:__ Most classes have 10+ students enrolled, and as a result, students can be found zoning out, on their phones, or simply not getting the full value of a class. <br><br> At Transform, we create a curriculum where our teachers __actively engage students with questions for the full session duration__, to ensure they receive the full attention and help they need. __Classes operate more like 1-on-1 tutoring, rather than a class.__
<br><br><br>
2. __Student Learning:__ Students need a comfortable environment to ask questions about content they don't understand. In a class with 10+ students, most students simply __don't__ speak up and ask questions. In a 1-on-2 environment where the teacher actively engages the students, our students do in fact speak up, resulting in a better learning experience.
<br><br><br>

Transform Tutoring is proud to pair your student with some of the Bay Area's most gifted teachers. We offer __summer classes__ from June - August and __mini-classes__ from August - June.

## Standardized Testing 

Getting into the nation's top university depends heavily on a student's SAT score. 

Often, students may be scoring well in one section (e.g. Math) while performing poorly in another section (e.g. Reading/Writing). We have options which allow students to register for only the areas they need help in, at the level that they need: 

* SAT Reading/Writing/Essay
* SAT Math
* Advanced Students: Path to a Perfect Reading / Writing Score
* Advanced Students: Path to a Perfect Math Score
